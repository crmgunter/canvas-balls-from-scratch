# Dots

This is a project I built out with canvas from scratch for the first time inspired by a tutorial I followed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO6OkltgudE&t=4s

This started as a project attempting to emulate gravity from what I'd learned in other tutorials but evolved into what became a rather un-fun game, but a game nonetheless. 

Check it out here or clone the repo down and tinker away!
